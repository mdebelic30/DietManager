# DietManager800G3



## SRC

- L1-L5 not implemented
- Do not use local variables as global to simplify your code:     private Recipe recipe = null;

## MVC

- The model should be in charge of loading the data, not the main app
- The view is decoupled from the controller :)
- CD needs to be corrected - the controller is a collection of Model objects

## NOTE

- Marija + Adrian + Felicio left for SW Dev, hence, these are new requirements regarding V2:
- Do not implement the part that deals with stats view
- From the Exercises-related functionality, implement only L1
- CD + SD for L1 are also required.
